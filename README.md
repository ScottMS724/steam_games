HELLO WORLD 

# SteamGames

This Ruby gem provides a CLI to view the 25 most recent video games under the "popular new releases" section of Steam's website. The CLI can also provide the date any specific video game was released and the review information for each video game, upon user request. Steam is a video game distribution software.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'steam_games'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install steam_games

## Usage

Type "./bin/steam_games" and follow the on-screen prompts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
